# Word Twister
Word Twister is a classic word scrambler game built by Congcong Li & Donnie Ellstrom at General Assembly. The application runs on the React framework and utilizes a custom built dictionary of words that are randomly scrambled. The player gains points by correctly organizing the characters of a given word. Using the hint functionality will arrange each character in the word one by one, but will impact the player's score at the end of the game. This project utilizes Javascript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and core React principles / data flow.

To install and run the application, fork or clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all associated dependencies.
Run `nodemon` to start a local server and navigate to localhost:3000 to view the application.
